# Manoa Snackbox
On campus vending machines made easy.

# About Manoa Snackbox
"I just walked halfway across campus and this machine doesn't sell that..."

Manoa Snackbox is an app that provides UH Manoa students with information on the contents of vending machines on campus.
Here students can find which nearby machines sell products they want, gain insight into which machines might be sold out, as well as view nutrition information on all drinks and snack items available.

#Examples of what this app will look like:

### Landing page
